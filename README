 
RSA Encryption & Decryption Application
A streamlined web application built with Streamlit for demonstrating RSA encryption and decryption algorithms.
Overview
This application provides an intuitive interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptographic algorithm. The system consists of two integrated modules that work seamlessly together through session state management.
RSA Algorithm
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption:
Key Generation Process

Prime Selection: Two distinct prime numbers (p and q) are randomly generated
Modulus Calculation: Compute n = p × q, which forms part of both public and private keys
Euler's Totient: Calculate φ(n) = (p-1) × (q-1)
Public Exponent: Select e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
Private Exponent: Compute d as the modular multiplicative inverse of e mod ulo φ(n)

Encryption
For a message M, the ciphertext C is computed as:
C = M^e mod n
Decryption
The original message M is recovered from ciphertext C using:
M = C^d mod n
Security Foundation
The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. While it is straightforward to multiply p and q to obtain n, deriving p and q from n alone is computationally infeasible for sufficiently large primes.
Features

Automated Key Generation: Dynamically generates RSA key pairs with configurable bit length
Seamless Integration: Encrypted data automatically transfers between encryption and decryption modules
Session State Management: Eliminates manual copy-pasting of keys and ciphertext
User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive design with clear visual feedback
Error Handling: Comprehensive validation and error messages

To run the code you will need the following libraries:
1) Streamlit
To download it run the code
    pip install streamlit
2) sympy
To download it run the code
    pip install sympy


How to use my code:
1) First open Terminal
2) Navigate to the location of the file using the 'cd' command.
3) Then run the command "streamlit run Encryption.py"
4) Repeat the step 3 for Decryption as well.

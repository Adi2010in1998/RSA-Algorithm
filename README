 
RSA Encryption & Decryption Application
A streamlined web application built with Streamlit for demonstrating RSA encryption and decryption algorithms.
Overview
This application provides an intuitive interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptographic algorithm. The system consists of two integrated modules that work seamlessly together through session state management.
RSA Algorithm
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption:

To run the code you will need the following libraries:
1) Streamlit
To download it run the code
    pip install streamlit
2) sympy
To download it run the code
    pip install sympy

How to use my code:
1) First open Terminal
2) Navigate to the location of the file using the 'cd' command.
3) Then run the command "streamlit run Encryption.py"
4) Repeat the step 3 for Decryption as well.

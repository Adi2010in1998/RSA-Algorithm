This is how it all works:
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption:

First the program selects 2 Prime Numbers(P,Q)

Then it calculates the product(P*Q)(N)

It calculates the Totient(P-1)*(Q-1)(T)

Then it selects a public key(E). This public key must:
1. be Prime
2. be Less than the Totient
3. NOT be a factor of the Totient

Then it selects a private key(D). This private key must:
1. (D*E)MOD(T) = 1

To encrypt a piece of information, following the algorithm it uses:
Text^E * MOD(N) = Cipher Text

To decrpyt a piece of information, following the algortihm it uses:
Cipher Text^D * MOD(N) = Text

The program converts the entered text into ASCII numerical values. After this are all the ASCII Values.
